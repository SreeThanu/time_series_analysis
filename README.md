# Time Series Demand Forecasting with ARIMA

This project involves time series analysis on energy demand data, specifically focusing on forecasting IT load demand using the ARIMA model. Through robust data preprocessing and model optimization, this project aims to deliver accurate demand predictions to aid in effective resource management.

## Dataset
The project uses a time series dataset of energy demand and solar generation metrics. The data is cleaned, processed, and analyzed to uncover seasonal trends and cyclical patterns.

## Model Training and Evaluation
- **Data Loading**: Data is loaded and preprocessed using `data_loader.py`.
- **Model Training**: Train the ARIMA model to forecast energy demand by executing `notebooks/train_arima.ipynb`.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy through residual analysis and forecast accuracy metrics.

## Key Functions
- **ARIMA Model**: Applied to capture and forecast demand patterns with adjustments for seasonality and trend.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, data transformation, and temporal feature extraction.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and trend analysis for model validation.

## Model Summary
The ARIMA model is optimized to accurately forecast demand by analyzing time-dependent patterns in the energy dataset. Key steps include data decomposition to understand trend and seasonality, followed by training the ARIMA model with optimal hyperparameters for reliable predictions.

## Results
The model provided high-precision demand forecasts, validated through residual diagnostics and error metrics, proving its effectiveness for short-term demand prediction.

## Usage

```python
# Example forecast
forecast = model.predict(start='YYYY-MM-DD', end='YYYY-MM-DD')
